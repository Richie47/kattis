Here you'll find some Kattis solutions made in my free time.

Kattis is a great place to practice problem solving skills, with tasks ranging from trivial to extremely difficult. I like Kattis because in addition to telling me how fast my code compiles; outside of a few test cases, the site won't tell you why you're failing testcase #21: because in the real world there is no set testcases.
